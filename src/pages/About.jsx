              I'm a dedicated and versatile developer with a focus on frontend
              development, specializing in JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS,
              Next.js, and Python. Currently in my third year of Computer
              Engineering studies, I'm passionate about merging the technical and
              visual aspects of digital products to create impactful user
              experiences. Crafting pixel-perfect designs and writing clean,
              high-performance code are my top priorities.

              My journey in web development began in 2020, and since then, I've
              continuously embraced new challenges and technologies to evolve as a
              developer. With over 3 years of experience, I'm now in my early
              twenties, leveraging modern tools like React.js, JavaScript,
              Nest.js, Tailwind CSS, and more to build cutting-edge web
              applications.

            <p>
              As a forward-thinking individual, I enjoy being involved in every
              stage of product development, from concept to execution.
